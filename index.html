    <h1>BREAKING NEWS THIS WEDNESDAY: TOM STINKS OUT ENTIRE CITY WITH RANCID STENCH</h1>
</header>

<section class="article">
    <h2>The Unbelievable Smell of Tom</h2>
    <p>
        Tom, a well-known figure in his community, has recently been the subject of widespread rumours, with some theories on his recent stench being deemed "wild" by avid reader, Poppy.
        Tommy Queue (born 10th April) is an man who recently developed a rather alarming stench.
        He was observed last Wednesday going for a walk to see his well known friend Jim, he was later seen stumbling out of the house looking rather intoxicated.
        A reporter from our paper was sent to examine the scene and they found something rather surprising... A pile of clothes, a bunch of fur (potentially dog) and a small puddle of blood!
        One of the most common theories about this new and abhorrent stench is that is related to the recently "disease" outbreak in the local area.
        We contacted a local expert to try and add substance to the claims of a lycanthropy outbreak in the Lower Westside of Cambridge city. He however, could not find any evidence of this, therefore it is the belief of this author that his stench merely comes from his continued consumption of oreo protein bars.

    <p>
        In other news, and on a completely unrelated note, there was a large black dog spotted recently in the Upper Westside of Cambridge. This dog apparently was spotted consuming copious amounts of frozen minced beef in the final aisle of Tesco.
        Authorities attempted to capture this dog, however no net could hold it and the tranquilizers were not strong enough to calm it. Tesco is now Â£850 out of pocket as the entire frozen meats section was consumed. They have declined to comment.
